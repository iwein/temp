Feature: Candidate sign up with target position
  This feature describes a candidate creating a target position

  Background:
     Given I post a new candidate

#Â Disabled because now it's not possible to create a employer without target position
#
# Scenario: Candidate should have no target position
#     When I invoke "/candidates/me/target_position" endpoint
#     Then The response status should be "200"
#      And The response should have:
#       """
#       null
#       """

# Scenario: Before target position is set signup stage should be false
#     When I invoke "/candidates/me/signup_stage" endpoint
#     Then The response status should be "200"
#      And The response should have:
#       """
#       { "target_position": false }
#       """

  Scenario: Candidate set target position
      When I post to "/candidates/me/target_position":
        """
