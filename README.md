### Available Environment

DEV Environment is deployed at:

* Frontend: [http://scotty-dev.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/](http://scotty-dev.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)
* API: [http://sheltered-meadow-1359.herokuapp.com/debug/](http://sheltered-meadow-1359.herokuapp.com/debug/)

Demo Environment is

* Frontend: ----
* API: [http://guarded-inlet-9319.herokuapp.com/debug](http://guarded-inlet-9319.herokuapp.com/debug)



### Setup local development environment:

* install postgres (9.3 recommended)
* install python 2.7, setuptools, virtualenv
* create a virtual environment for this project, activate it
* run <code>python setup.py develop</code> for this project
* copy a local.ini config file with proper Postgres Connection Strings, <code>sqlalchemy.url</code>
  * note this is mentioned twice in the config file
* run <code>alembic -c [CONFIG] upgrade head</code>
* start the server with <code>paste serve --reload configs/[CONFIG]</code>
* open a browser on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Pulling Code and Upgrading API

After each pull it is advised you
* run <code>alembic -c [CONFIG] upgrade head</code>

All data model changes get set up through this cmd.
If you see unexpect errors in the API, make sure to run the script.

If this script fails with "Unknown revision .....", you will need to empty out the DB and run the command again.
This will destroy all test data, and thats ok.

Reset the db by running the following in postgres on the relevant database:

    drop schema public cascade;
    create schema public;

and then

* run <code>alembic -c [CONFIG] upgrade head</code>

For production dependencies should be installed with `npm install`.
Build process is executed with `grunt build`

#### Unbuild

To return to development mode after build two commands are required:

* `grunt clean`
* `git checkout public`

If you know a simpler way to do this please let me know.

#### Tests

To run the test `npm install` is required. Grunt tasks are:

* `grunt test:unit`: To run unit tests
* `grunt test:e2e`: To execute end to end tests
* `grunt test`: All tests with linting
