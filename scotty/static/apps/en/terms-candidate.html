The 4Scotty Platform will match the entered specifications against the profile information submitted by candidates and search for those candidates qualified for and interested in that particular position. The 4Scotty Platform provides quick and efficient access to candidates who might not have actively applied for a vacant position with a prospective employer’s company. Such prospective employer may send the job description along with a job offer (the <b>“Job Offer”</b>) directly to the Candidate who may confirm their interest by accepting the Job Offer in their own discretion (the <b>“Confirmation”</b>). A Job Offer will contain an invitation to open direct communication between a prospective employer and the Candidate (e.g. a job interview, a telephone interview or any other direct exchange of communication). It is in Candidate’s free discretion to give a Confirmation to enter such communication.</li>
                <li>The contact with a potential employer via the 4Scotty Platform may result in the conclusion of a contract regarding the employment of the work services of Candidate as an employee, intern, consultant or contractor (an <b>“Employment Contract”</b>).

The Referral Bonus shall be due to the recommending user if the Candidate enters into an Employment Contract and the employer has paid out the contractual fee to 4Scotty.  4Scotty refers the right to terminate the Agreement and suspend the access to the Services to a user once such user has received more than one Referral Bonus.</li>
            </li>

                <li>The Services provided hereunder are limited to the provision of a platform to submit profile information. 4Scotty does not act as an agent for the purposes of the Job offer process or any further communication between prospective employer and Candidate. 4Scotty merely provides a platform to enable Candidate to find and connect with potential employers.</li>
                <li>In particular, 4Scotty does not check whether it would be detrimental to the interests of either the Candidate or an employer to work in a position the employer seeks to fill.</li>

                <li>Liability for loss of data is limited to the typical effort required to restore the data which would exist where backup copies had been produced regularly and in line with the risks involved.</li>
                <li>The limitations to liability set out above shall also apply to personal liability of agents, employees and representatives of 4Scotty by means of protective effective effect to such third parties.</li>
