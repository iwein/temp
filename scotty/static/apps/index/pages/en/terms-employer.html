          TERMS OF SERVICE FOR THE USE OF THE 4SCOTTY SERVICES BY JOB PROVIDERS (“Client Terms”)

          <ul class="terms-outer">
            <li>
              <h3 class="static-mid-title">GENERAL</h3>
              <ul class="terms-inner">
                <li>These terms and conditions (the <b>“Client Terms”</b>) apply to the use of the 4Scotty Website containing user generated profiles of prospective candidates in the IT sector (<b>“4Scotty Platform”</b>). The implementation of these Client Terms require the timely and speedy reaction to any contact requests or correspondence made lawfully via the 4Scotty Platform. The 4Scotty Platform is provided by 4Scotty to the potential employer (the <b>“Client”</b>). The Client Terms are accepted upon (i) Client’s registration which is free of charge and (ii) clicking on the acceptance button of these Client Terms (<b>“Registration”</b>).</li>
                <li>The Registration will require client to submit the following mandatory elements:
                  <ul class="bulleted">
                    <li>Client’s name (usually company name);</li>
                    <li>Client’s contact details;</li>
                    <li>brief description of the Client;</li>
                    <li>names of the users entitled to use the Service on behalf of the employer (Section 1.8).</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>4Scotty accepts the Registration provided the information submitted is sufficient to meet 4Scotty’s quality criteria in 4Scotty’s reasonable discretion (the <b>“Acceptance”</b>). In case of Acceptance, Client will receive a confirmation e-mail by 4Scotty which concludes the framework agreement (the <b>“Agreement”</b>) governing the relationship between Candidate and 4Scotty. If 4Scotty rejects a Registry, 4Scotty will not use any information submitted by the Client.</li>
                <li>Access and use of the 4Scotty Platform (the <b>“Services”</b>) is exclusively designed for and provided to employers and individuals seeking a role with an employer, age 18 years or over. The Services shall not be used by persons or companies representing or acting as recruiting agencies, recruiting consultants or "headhunters". By registering for the Services you represent and warrant that you are using the Services on behalf, on account and for the benefit of one employer only.</li>
                <li>Clients may directly search by specifying the candidate’s requirements for vacant positions. The 4Scotty Platform will match the entered specifications against the profile information submitted by candidates and search for those candidates qualified for and interested in that particular position. The 4Scotty Platform provides quick and efficient access to candidates who might not have actively applied for a vacant position with the Client’s company. Client may send the job description along with a job offer (the <b>“Job Offer”</b>) directly to the candidates who may confirm their interest by accepting the Job Offer in their own discretion (the <b>“Confirmation”</b>). A Job Offer will contain an invitation to open direct communication between the Client and the respective candidate (e.g. a job interview, a telephone interview or any other direct exchange of communication). It is in the candidate’s free discretion to give a Confirmation to enter such communication.</li>
                <li>If 4Scotty has reasons to believe that the Services are being used by unauthorized individuals as defined in Section 1.3, 4Scotty will suspend the account until provided facts to the contrary.</li>
                <li>Client is provided Login ID’s and corresponding account passwords (<b>“Login Information”</b>) to access its user account (<b>“User Account”</b>) on the 4Scotty Platform.</li>
                <li>Client will bind his employees or any other user of Client’s User Account accordingly in order to ensure that only designated personnel authorized by the Client will use the Login Information to access and use the 4Scotty Platform. All entitled personnel must register individually by name, contact details and working title and must be entitled to represent the Client with legal effect.</li>
                <li>Client will also ensure that the Login Information is kept strictly confidential at all times in order to ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot access the 4Scotty Platform. If 4Scotty has reasons to believe that the Login Information is being used by unauthorized individuals, 4Scotty will suspend Client’s account until the resolution of the issue.</li>
