The Referral Bonus shall be due to the recommending user if the Candidate enters into an Employment Contract and the employer has paid out the contractual fee to 4Scotty.  4Scotty refers the right to terminate the Agreement and suspend the access to the Services to a user once such user has received more than one Referral Bonus.</li>
