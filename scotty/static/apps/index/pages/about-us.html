      <p class="alg-cen">The current recruitment practices in the IT sector is quite a challenge - for both sides.
        Employers are desperately looking for IT professionals - with great effort and little chance of success. Does not have their own IT on the right experts can easily have serious impact on business performance. But it found no suitable candidates. The software experts on the other hand not know about her talent, but often where they can use it better than in their current job. Instead, they are a intransparentem market opposite. Those calls all look the same and the actually relevant information on the used technologies or specific salary offer is missing. Requests from employment agencies are often inappropriate and annoying.</p>
      <p class="alg-cen">To fix the process in the core, we have built 4Scotty. We believe that everyone benefits from a transparent exchange in which everyone plays with open cards. And the key for us is to respond to the needs of IT experts. Unlike other platforms, not the candidate, but interested companies bidding to compete with these concrete and individual job offers. The candidate can then decide what it sounds exciting enough for an introduction.</p>
